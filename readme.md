The split method is used to split a string into an array of substrings, and returns the new array.
Spread Syntax
Write a function that takes 3 parameters: name, location, favFood and logs them to the console (either separately or all at once using a template literal).
Create an array with 3 values, have the values match the order of the 3 parameters. Ex. let arr = ["Paul", "Birmingham", "Kimchi"];
Spread operators allow us to take multiple values, like an array, and insert them as 3 separate values. Using a spread operator, insert the values of the array into the function, check the console and see what appears.
Create a variable and set the value to your name.
Write a function that takes a parameter, name the parameter whatever youâ€™d like.
Using spread syntax, create a variable in the function that takes the string you pass into the function and spreads it into an array.
Using a for loop, loop through the spread string and console log each value of the string.
Call the function created in step 5 by passing in the variable created in step 4.
